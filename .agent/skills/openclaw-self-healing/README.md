## 🔥 Why This Exists

> **OpenClaw** is a self-hosted AI gateway (Claude/GPT-4 routing + session management). This system wraps it with autonomous crash recovery.

Your OpenClaw Gateway crashes at midnight. A basic watchdog restarts it — but what if the config is corrupted? The API rate limit hit? A dependency broken?

**Simple restart = crash loop.** You get paged. Your weekend is ruined.

**This system doesn't just restart — it understands and fixes root causes.**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **macOS 12+** or **Linux** (Ubuntu 20.04+ / systemd)
- **[OpenClaw Gateway](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)** installed and running
- **Any major LLM** — Claude CLI (default), OpenAI, Gemini, or Ollama. See [LLM-Agnostic](#-llm-agnostic-recovery-new-in-v33)
- `tmux`, `jq` (`brew install tmux jq` or `apt install tmux jq`)

### Install (5 minutes)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramsbaby/openclaw-self-healing/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer walks you through everything:

```

### Verify It Works

```bash
# Kill your Gateway to test auto-recovery
kill -9 $(pgrep -f openclaw-gateway)

# Wait ~30 seconds, then check
curl http://localhost:18789/
# Expected: HTTP 200 ✅
```

### Each Level Explained

| Level | What | When | How |
|-------|------|------|-----|
| **0** | Preflight Validation | Every cold start | Validate binary, .env keys, JSON configs before exec |
| **1** | LaunchAgent KeepAlive | Any crash | Instant restart (0–30s) |
| **2** | Watchdog v4.1 + HealthCheck | Repeated crashes | PID + HTTP + memory monitoring, exponential backoff |
| **3** | AI Emergency Recovery | 30min continuous failure | PTY session → log analysis → auto-fix (Claude/GPT-4/Gemini/Ollama) |
| **4** | Human Alert | All automation fails | Discord/Telegram with full context |

**Level 0 (new in v3.2):** Catches config corruption, missing .env keys, and broken JSON *before* the gateway even starts — preventing crash loops from bad config entirely.

---

## 📊 Real Production Numbers

Based on an audit of 14 real incidents (Feb 2026):

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| 17 consecutive crashes | ✅ Full recovery via Level 1 |
| Config corruption | ✅ Auto-fixed in ~3 min |
| All services killed (nuclear) | ✅ Recovered in ~3 min |
| 38+ crash loop | ⛔ Stopped by design (prevents infinite loops) |

**9 of 14 incidents resolved fully autonomously.** The remaining 5 escalated correctly to Level 4 — the system worked as designed.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Level 0: Preflight 🔍 (every cold start)
│  Validates binary, .env keys, JSON configs before exec
│  On failure: AI recovery session (tmux) + exponential backoff
│  scripts/gateway-preflight.sh
│
▼  passes
Level 1: KeepAlive ⚡ (0-30s)
│  Instant restart on any crash
│  Built into ai.openclaw.gateway.plist
│
▼  repeated failures
Level 2: Watchdog v4.1 🔍 (3-5 min)
│  HTTP + PID + memory monitoring every 3 min
│  Exponential backoff: 10s → 30s → 90s → 180s → 600s
│  Crash counter auto-decay after 6 hours
│
▼  30 minutes of continuous failure
Level 3: AI Emergency Recovery 🧠 (5-30 min)
│  Auto-triggered — no manual intervention
│  Supports Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Ollama (OPENCLAW_LLM_PROVIDER)
│  PTY session: reads logs → diagnoses → fixes
│  Documents learnings for future incidents
│
▼  all automation fails
Level 4: Human Alert 🚨
   Discord/Telegram notification with full context
   Log paths + recovery report attached
```

## ✅ What v3.2 Added

| Before v3.2 | After v3.2 |
|-------------|------------|
| Config corruption caused crash loops at start | Preflight catches it before exec |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` silently missing in tmux sessions spawned from launchd | Key forwarded via `tmux -e` flag |
| No proactive validation layer | Level 0: gateway-preflight.sh |

### Previous: What v3.1 Fixed

| Before v3.1 | After v3.1 |
|-------------|------------|
| Manual LaunchAgent/systemd setup | `install.sh` does everything |
| `.env` had to be created by hand | Interactive wizard generates it |
| Level 2 → Level 3 was disconnected | Auto-triggers after 30 min |
| macOS only | macOS + Linux (systemd) |
| Install often failed mid-way | Verified end-to-end |

---

## 🤖 LLM-Agnostic Recovery (New in v3.3)

Level 3 Emergency Recovery is no longer Claude-only. Set `OPENCLAW_LLM_PROVIDER` in your `.env`:

| Provider | Config | Default model | Requires |
|----------|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Claude** (default) | `OPENCLAW_LLM_PROVIDER=claude` | Claude Code CLI | Claude Max subscription |
| **OpenAI** | `OPENCLAW_LLM_PROVIDER=openai` | `gpt-4o` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` + `pip install openai` |
| **Google Gemini** | `OPENCLAW_LLM_PROVIDER=gemini` | `gemini-2.0-flash` | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` + `pip install google-generativeai` |
| **Ollama** (local/offline) | `OPENCLAW_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama` | `llama3.2` | Ollama running locally |

```bash
# Switch to GPT-4o
echo 'OPENCLAW_LLM_PROVIDER=openai' >> ~/.openclaw/.env
echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...'        >> ~/.openclaw/.env

# Fully offline with Ollama (no API key needed)
echo 'OPENCLAW_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama' >> ~/.openclaw/.env
echo 'OPENCLAW_LLM_MODEL=llama3.2'  >> ~/.openclaw/.env
```

Implementation: [`scripts/lib/llm-gateway.sh`](scripts/lib/llm-gateway.sh)

## 📈 Prometheus Metrics (New in v3.3)

Expose real-time recovery metrics for Grafana dashboards and alerting rules.

| Metric | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `openclaw_gateway_healthy` | gauge | 1 if gateway returns HTTP 200, 0 otherwise |
| `openclaw_recovery_attempts` | gauge | Total Level-3 recovery attempts |
| `openclaw_recovery_success` | gauge | Successful recoveries |
| `openclaw_recovery_failed` | gauge | Failed recoveries |
| `openclaw_recovery_rate_percent` | gauge | Autonomous recovery success rate (0–100) |
| `openclaw_last_recovery_duration_seconds` | gauge | Duration of last recovery attempt |
| `openclaw_last_recovery_success` | gauge | 1 if last recovery succeeded, 0 if failed |
| `openclaw_last_recovery_timestamp_seconds` | gauge | Unix timestamp of last recovery |

```bash
# Start the exporter (port 9090 by default)
bash scripts/start-metrics-exporter.sh start

# Test
curl -s http://localhost:9090/metrics

# Stop / restart
bash scripts/start-metrics-exporter.sh stop
bash scripts/start-metrics-exporter.sh restart

# Custom port
OPENCLAW_METRICS_PORT=8080 bash scripts/start-metrics-exporter.sh start
```

### Prometheus scrape config

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'openclaw'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
    scrape_interval: 30s
```

### Grafana alerting example

```
# Alert: gateway down for >5 minutes
openclaw_gateway_healthy == 0

# Alert: recovery rate drops below 50%
openclaw_recovery_rate_percent < 50
```

Implementation: [`scripts/prometheus-exporter.py`](scripts/prometheus-exporter.py) · [`scripts/start-metrics-exporter.sh`](scripts/start-metrics-exporter.sh)
